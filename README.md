## Projects
### Keylogger
[Project Link](https://github.com/cybersamarth/Keylogger)

Simple node.js linux only(for now) keylogger using events.

It's working exactly as: https://github.com/Bornholm/node-keyboard

I just rewrote it as simple as possible without requiring any modules and using fs.createReadStream instead of fs.open.

### /IP-Origin-Finder-Protected-By-Cloudflare
[Project Link](https://github.com/cybersamarth/IP-Origin-Finder-Protected-By-Cloudflare)

cloudflare-origin-ip
Try to find the origin IP of a webapp protected by Cloudflare.
Description
This Python tool compares the HTTP response of the given subdomain to HTTP responses of a list of IPs addresses. This list is based on:

subdomains supplied by the user
subdomains found on external sources
IPs found external sources
Then, a score of similarity is calculated for each response using the Levenshtein algorithm.
