###  About Me
-I'm based in Bangalore, a vibrant city that fuels my diverse interests and pursuits. As a Security Researcher, I constantly delve into the intricacies of digital landscapes, ensuring a safer online environment for all. Alongside this, my penchant for writing allows me to articulate complex ideas, stories, and insights.

Volunteering has always held a special place in my heart. It's a testament to my commitment to give back to the community and make a tangible difference in people's lives. When I'm not immersed in these endeavors, you'll often find me engrossed in discussions about politics, exploring its nuances, and staying updated on current events.

Furthermore, programming serves as both a hobby and a tool for me. It offers a creative outlet and enables me to bring innovative ideas to life.
